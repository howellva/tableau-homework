As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike Program, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.
Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.
However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

Today, what are the most popular and least popular stations in the city for ending a journey?  

At first, I wanted to take an upper level look to see where all of the end stations are and get a visual representation at what this looks like.  

The next thing to look at was to identify exactly what were the most popular and least popular cities by filtering through the data. 

Although having the names of these stations is useful, understanding where they are was the logical next step.  

It can be seen that, the most popular end stations were in Jersey City and the least popular were mostly in Manhattan. Perhaps this has something to do with the direction of the commute to work?
