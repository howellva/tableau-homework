As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike Program, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.
Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.
However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

Today, what are the most popular and least popular stations in the city for ending a journey?  

At first, I wanted to take an upper level look to see where all of the end stations are and get a visual representation at what this looks like.  

The next thing to look at was to identify exactly what were the most popular and least popular cities by filtering through the data. 

Although having the names of these stations is useful, understanding where they are was the logical next step.  

It can be seen that, the most popular end stations were in Jersey City and the least popular were mostly in Manhattan. Perhaps this has something to do with the direction of the commute to work?

How does the average trip duration change by age? 

Something I noticed right away with this data was the presence of an outlier. There are 25 people who claimed to be born in 1888 which would be impossible. There may be something wrong in the way that this data was collected. The peak riders are those born in the late 80s (millenials). 

The longest duration for ride was found to be those who were born in 2000. Therefore, younger riders tend to have a longer duration of ride.
